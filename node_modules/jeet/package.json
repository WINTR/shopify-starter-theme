You can think of it like the spiritual successor to [Semantic.gs](http://semantic.gs/).\n\nBy making use of the power of pre-processors, we can now pass real fractions (or float numbers) as context that generates a percentage based width and gutter for grids. We're able to do this while maintaining a consistently sized infinitely nestable gutter.\n\nCheck out [this presentation](http://corysimmons.github.io/presentations/jeet-5) to learn more about what sets Jeet above other grid systems, then enjoy one of Jeet's many pre-processor flavors:\n\n- [Stylus](stylus)\n- [SCSS](scss)\n\nWant to sandbox it right this very second? Fork some examples on [CodePen](http://codepen.io/collection/eilAH/).\n\n#### Jeet Projects\n- [generator-jeet](https://github.com/juliancwirko/generator-jeet) - [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) generator with [LiveReload](http://livereload.com) for Jeet\n- [jeet-gulp](https://github.com/muraken720/jeet-gulp) - [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) project with [LiveReload](http://livereload.com) for Jeet\n\n#### Browser Support\n- IE9+ and all major browsers without polyfills like Selectivizr\n- With a nice boilerplate like [Boy](http://github.com/corysimmons/boy), seamless and responsive in IE7+ ([gallery](http://imgur.com/a/Z0YPD))\n\n---\n\n##### Jeet is curated by loving hands at...\n<a href=\"http://mojotech.com\"><img width=\"140px\" src=\"https://mojotech.github.io/jeet/img/mojotech-logo.svg\" title=\"MojoTech's Hiring\"></a> <sup>(psst, [we're hiring](http://www.mojotech.com/jobs))</sup>\n\n##### Thanks\n- **[Mitchell Coote](http://monkeez.com)** - For contributing the sweet goodness of consistently sized gutters even in nested contexts (seriously-tricky-business).\n- **[Hugo Giraudel](http://hugogiraudel.com)** - For his huge contributions to the SCSS port.\n- **[Jeff Escalante](https://github.com/jenius)** - For his patience and guidance with this project.\n- **[Carrot Creative](http://carrot.is)** - For keeping up with Jeet and using it on some of the [biggest companies](http://carrot.is/creative) in the world.\n- **[Kenichiro Murata](https://github.com/muraken720)** - For his continual support and for creating/maintaining [jeet-gulp](https://github.com/muraken720/jeet-gulp).\n- **[Julian Ä†wirko](http://www.wavesofideas.com/)** - For creating/maintaining the Yeoman [generator-jeet](https://github.com/juliancwirko/generator-jeet).\n- **[The rest of ya's](https://github.com/mojotech/jeet/graphs/contributors)** - Thanks for your love.
